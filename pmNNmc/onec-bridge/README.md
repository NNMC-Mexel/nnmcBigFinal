# 1C read-only bridge

Windows-only HTTP bridge used by `server-kpi` to read conducted timesheets from
1C through `V83.COMConnector`. It does not modify the 1C configuration or data.

## Requirements

- Windows x64 with Node.js 20+.
- 1C platform and registered `V83.COMConnector`.
- Network access to the 1C server.
- A dedicated 1C account with read-only access to
  `Документ.ТабельУчетаРабочегоВремени`.

## Configuration

Copy `env.example` to local `.env` and update its values. Do not commit
credentials. The bridge and `server-kpi` must use the same
`ONEC_BRIDGE_TOKEN`.

Create an encrypted credential file while logged in as the Windows account that
will run the bridge:

```powershell
Get-Credential | Export-Clixml C:\NNMC\onec-bridge\onec-credential.xml
```

Set `ONEC_CREDENTIAL_PATH` to that file. Windows encrypts its password so only
the same Windows account on the same computer can decrypt it.

Create `.env` and a random bridge token:

```powershell
.\scripts\configure.ps1
```

The script prints the two values that must be configured in `server-kpi`.

Example start from PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:ONEC_BRIDGE_TOKEN = Read-Host "Bridge token"
$env:ONEC_SERVER = "kufib"
$env:ONEC_DATABASE = "copy10062025"
$env:ONEC_CREDENTIAL_PATH = "C:\NNMC\onec-bridge\onec-credential.xml"
npm start
```

Restrict inbound Windows Firewall access to the `server-kpi` host. The bridge
must not be exposed to the public internet.

Verify it locally:

```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod http://127.0.0.1:12110/health
$department = [Uri]::EscapeDataString("Администрация (клиника)")
Invoke-RestMethod "http://127.0.0.1:12110/timesheets?year=2026&month=5&department=$department" `
  -Headers @{ "X-Bridge-Token" = $env:ONEC_BRIDGE_TOKEN }
```

## API

- `GET /health`
- `GET /timesheets?year=2026&month=5&department=...`
- `GET /timesheets?year=2026&month=5&department=...&refresh=1`
- `GET /timesheets/:id`
- `GET /timesheets/:id?refresh=1`

All `/timesheets` requests require header `X-Bridge-Token`.

The bridge keeps a persistent local cache in `ONEC_BRIDGE_DATA_DIR`. Every day
at `ONEC_BRIDGE_DAILY_SYNC_HOUR` in Windows local time it loads the complete
conducted-timesheet lists for the previous and current calendar months. During
the rest of the day those lists are served from disk and memory without calling
1C again. `ONEC_BRIDGE_DAILY_LIST_LIMIT` controls the safety limit for each
monthly snapshot.

Selected timesheet details are loaded on demand and then kept in the persistent
cache. During the next daily sync, details that users previously selected are
refreshed too. Cached data outside the previous and current calendar months is
removed. Add `refresh=1` to bypass and replace the relevant cached list or
detail. The KPI interface exposes this behavior through the `Обновить из 1С`
button.

If the bridge restarts after the configured daily sync hour and today's sync
has not completed yet, it starts the two-month synchronization automatically.
